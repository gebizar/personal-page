                            <p>
                                As a recent graduate of the University of Washington Information School, I strive to leverage my broad skillset to shape the ever-changing landscape of the tech-world. 
                                Having been raised in Singapore, Taiwan, and the U.S., my diverse upbringing has strengthened my need to be inclusionary, and therefore bolster diversity in any community I belong to. 
                                My want to bridge communities is further enforced, by my two-years as an resident adviser 
                                in which I utilized Mandarin to engage with International Students and eventually incorporate them as part of the larger UW community.  
                                In addition to being in student leadership, having participated in many project teams through school and my internship in Intel has given me insight to aligning project visions between those of engineers, project managers,  
                                and data scientists. My experience in having spent hours tirelessly coding and enthusiastically engaging with those that I've presented projects to (regardless of language) has culminated in my ability to bring visions to life on all fronts.

                                    Having interned at Intel has definitely solidified my want and need to be within tech. 
                                    The full experience of soaking in a beautiful city such as Folsom, CA. 
                                    working alongside talented individuals,
                                     and being under the tutelage of motivated mentors was an immense privilege to me. 
                                     I was able to learn create websites and understand the logistics behind internal products used by tech giants such as Intel, 
                                    as well as develop a grasp on the inner machinations of the tech industry as a whole. 
                                    Although my skills as a web developer vastly improved over the course of this internship it has also opened my eyes to the number of possibilites in tech and has stirred in me an excitement to meet other likeminded individuals.

                                    Over the course of two years spent as a Resident Adviser, I think I've fully bolstered the skills of conflict mediation and bridging communities. In particular, I spent time in the dorms Mercer Court and Lander, both of which are specifically catered towards international students due to their availability over the Winter Break. My ability to speak Chinese has garnered testimonials in my ability to bridge the culture gap, ease tension, and build rapport with people, both domestic and international.
                                    In 2017, I achieved the "Dubs Up!" award, an granted to communtiy leaders at UW, of which only two were granted to our building staff of over 40. My love for interaction with all walks of life and strong social skills lead me to believe that I'm a strong candidate for any position that interacts with a diverse cast of occupations, origins, and creeds. From engineers to non-technical folks to the international and domestic, my life's mission is bridge communities and challenge people to achieve their best.

                                My primary task on my Capstone Senior project was to implement a database for use with Google Home's so people could order intuitively, more sentence-like, than a typical option tree. I facilitated the creation of an API that double checked to see if menu items were in a restaurants database prior to confirming the order. In short, I created the backend to ensure that after the language was parsed the item even existed. It was intensely challenging and in conjunction with other developers using language parsing libraries such as spaCy, it really brought to light just how insanely difficult it is to work with language parsing.

                                For my visualizations class I had to create a narrative/teaching piece to demonstrate a subject that I was personally interested in. I've always loved board games and poker ever since my grandfater taught me how to play and as a result we decided to showcase the statistics behind hands using React, Idyll, and JavaScript. We leveraged D3 and Tableau to find metrics that we thought were fun to showcase before implementation. All animations, all of the code, and the coordination as a team was my work. Enjoy and take a look at my poker animations!

                                <p> This website was developed as a testament to my abilities as a front-end developer and a more expansive, holsitic view of my resume. I initially wanted to create this website using a framework such as Angular or React, but recently read an article about the over-abundance of single-page websites that utilize frameworks (unncessary overhead;) or websites that needlessly use flowery, multi-page html that serve to detract from user experience. Everything that you see was handcoded, without the help of templates and was storyboarded prior to development for flow and ease. If you have any questions on how I developed this website or would like to look at the source code, feel free. </p>
